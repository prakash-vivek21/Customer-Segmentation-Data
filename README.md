# Customer Segmentation Data Analysis (Clustering)

### Project Overview
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. By analyzing various customer attributes, we can identify distinct groups within the customer base, which can help tailor marketing strategies, improve customer service, and optimize product offerings.

### Features Analyzed
* Age
* Income
* Spending Score
* Membership Years
* Purchase Frequency
* Last Purchase Amount

### Clustering Techniques Used
- K-Means Clustering
- Agglomerative Clustering

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the most significant components. The analysis indicated that 8 components were needed to preserve 95% of the variance.

### Clusters Identified
Through the clustering process, we identified 11 distinct customer clusters. Here, we provide detailed insights for the top 4 clusters:

### Insights from Top 4 Clusters
* Cluster 0
  -Customer Base: Largest cluster.
  -Demographic Profile: Younger customers with higher incomes.
  -Category Preference: Strong preference for Electronics.

* Cluster 1
  -Customer Base: Second largest cluster.
  -Demographic Profile: Predominantly males and other genders with higher incomes.
  -Category Preference: Strong preference for Sports products.

* Cluster 5
  -Customer Base: Diverse group including mostly females and other genders.
  -Demographic Profile: Older customers with higher incomes.
  -Category Preference: Interest in both Electronics and Sports.

* Cluster 2
  -Customer Base: Mix of male and female customers.
  -Demographic Profile: Relatively lower income levels.
  -Category Preference: Broad interest in Home & Garden, Sports, and Electronics.
